 * DRUM_INSTRUMENT_MAP defines the visual and structural properties for each drum kit element
 * when rendered on a single 5-line percussion staff using VexFlow.
 * The 'keys' property defines the vertical position on the staff using "note/octave" strings (e.g., "F/3" for kick drum).
 * These are string representations of note pitches that VexFlow uses for vertical placement,
 * NOT necessarily their melodic pitch value.
 * 'notehead' defines custom notehead shapes (e.g., 'x', 'triangle').
 * 'stemDirection' defines the stem direction (up or down) using `Stem.UP`, `Stem.DOWN`, `Stem.NONE`.
 * 'modifiers' define VexFlow articulations or custom annotations for specific techniques.
 * 'isRest' indicates if the element is a rest.
